In this Power BI report, we perform a detailed analysis of customer churn for a large commercial bank.

This report provides an in-depth analysis of customer churn at a bank, based on the attached dashboard. The analysis identifies key patterns and trends that impact customer retention, with the objective of driving actionable insights to minimize churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Churn Drivers by Key Metrics

  - Age Group 21–30: Second-highest churn rate (~500 customers, ~30% churn rate).

  - Credit Scores <500 and >700: Lower churn rates.

## Recommendations to Reduce Customer Churn

 Based on the insights from the dashboard, here are targeted recommendations to address churn and improve customer retention:

- **Targeted Retention Strategies by Customer Segments**
  
   - Age Group 31–40:
   
     This group exhibits the highest churn rate. Develop tailored products like family-oriented savings plans, flexible loan options, or mid-career investment opportunities to cater to 
     their financial needs.
   
   - Inactive Customers:
   
     Reactivate this group through personalized communication, exclusive offers, or discounts to encourage account usage and engagement.
   
- **  Product-Specific Improvements**
  
   - Product 4:

     Investigate the reasons for high churn by collecting customer feedback. Improve the product's features, pricing, or support. Highlight the value of Product 4 in marketing 
     campaigns  to change perceptions.

   - Promote Product 1:

     Since Product 1 has the lowest churn, analyze what makes it successful and apply those elements to other products. Use it as a flagship offering to attract and retain customers.
  
- **  Region-Specific Approaches**

   - France and Spain:
     
     Focus retention efforts in these regions with customized loyalty programs, improved customer service, and culturally relevant marketing strategies.

   - Germany:

     Even though churn is lower, continue monitoring and strengthening customer relationships to prevent potential increases.

- **  Credit Card Adoption**

   - Promote credit cards as a retention tool:
   - Offer introductory benefits like 0% interest for a limited period, cashback, or reward points to non-credit card customers.
   - Highlight the advantages of owning a credit card to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

 - **  Personalized Engagement for Account Balances**

   - Low-Balance Customers (<20K):
     
     Offer free financial education programs or tools to help manage their finances better. Provide no-fee accounts or small benefits to encourage savings and loyalty.

   - High-Balance Customers (>120K):
     
     Retain this high-value segment with premium services like dedicated relationship managers, exclusive investment opportunities, or customized wealth management plans.

     By implementing these recommendations, the bank can tackle churn holistically, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain a strong, loyal customer base.
